## What is MyScribe Wallet?

MyScribe Wallet is an open-source, non-custodial Bitcoin browser extension built for consumers. It combines **OPNet smart contract** support with native **Ordinals inscription** browsing and **Fractal Bitcoin** support, all wrapped in a clean, distinctive UI.

MyScribe Wallet is a community fork of [OP_WALLET](https://github.com/btc-vision/opwallet) that extends the OPNet ecosystem with:

- **Ordinals support restored** — Inscriptions fetched via `ordinals.com` + `mempool.space` APIs. Inline preview rendering via `ordinals.com/preview/{id}`. No Hiro dependency.
- **Fractal Bitcoin Mainnet** — First-class network support out of the box. Send, receive, and inscribe large file types on Fractal Bitcoin's fast, low-fee chain.
- **Consumer-focused UX** — Taproot-only wallet creation, always-on UTXO protection for Ordinals, simplified onboarding. Advanced developer features (contract deployment) removed for clarity.
- **MyScribe branding** — Sharp corners, gold gradient accents, visible container borders, custom logo and iconography.
- **OPNet WalletConnect integration** — Detects as `window.myscribe` for dApp connectivity via `@btc-vision/walletconnect`. [PR #23](https://github.com/btc-vision/walletconnect/pull/23) adds MyScribe to the official wallet connect modal.

## Installation

### Chrome Web Store

Install directly from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/myscribe-wallet/fohjnnfmmfaiilnbnbokkfmdienjdfck). Works on Chrome, Brave, Edge, and Opera.

### Manual Install

1. Download or build from source (see below)
2. Go to `chrome://extensions/` (or equivalent)
3. Enable Developer Mode
4. Click **Load unpacked**
5. Select the `dist/chrome` folder

### Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MyScribe-Ecosystem/MyScribe-Wallet.git
cd MyScribe-Wallet
npm install

# Production build (all 3 stages, skips lint gate)
npm run build:chrome:fast

# Production build (with lint + circular dep checks)
npm run build:chrome

# Dev with hot reload
npm run dev:chrome
```

Requires Node.js 24+.

## dApp Integration

MyScribe Wallet injects `window.myscribe` on every page (does **not** conflict with `window.opnet` — OP_WALLET and MyScribe coexist cleanly). dApps using `@btc-vision/walletconnect` will show MyScribe in the wallet connect modal once [PR #23](https://github.com/btc-vision/walletconnect/pull/23) is merged.

For dApp developers building with the MyScribe SDK fork today:

```bash
npm install github:MyScribe-Ecosystem/myscribe-opnet-sdk
```

```tsx
import { WalletConnectProvider, useWalletConnect, SupportedWallets } from '@myscribe/walletconnect';

// MyScribe appears alongside OP_WALLET in the connect modal
<WalletConnectProvider theme="dark">
  <App />
</WalletConnectProvider>
```

## Security & Upstream

MyScribe Wallet is built on [OP_WALLET](https://github.com/btc-vision/opwallet), which was audited by [Verichains](https://verichains.io). **No core wallet logic has been modified** — key management, transaction signing, PSBT construction, OPNet smart contract interaction, and ML-DSA cryptography are all inherited directly from OP_WALLET without changes.

MyScribe-specific changes are limited to:
- UI/branding (colors, logos, corner radii, typography)
- Ordinals browsing support (new `OrdinalsAPI.ts` service + UI screens)
- Fractal Bitcoin Mainnet enabled as a default network
- Consumer UX guardrails (Taproot-only creation, always-on UTXO protection, Address Type settings removed)
- `window.myscribe` provider injection for WalletConnect SDK detection

Upstream OP_WALLET updates are tracked via the GitHub fork relationship.
